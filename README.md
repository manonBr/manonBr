### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Manon a former full-stack webdeveloper (PHP) who fell in love with front-end development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a webapp to help writers finding beta readers

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: www.manonbruimaud.fr
- âš¡ Fun fact: I first started to developp because one day, 10 years ago, I got bored. I've started with some game in C and then change for webdevelopment.

Feel free to contact me if you have any question.
