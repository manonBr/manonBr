### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Manon a former full-stack webdeveloper (PHP) who fell in love with front-end development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a webapp to help writers finding beta readers efficiently.

- âš¡ Fun fact: About 10 years ago, I became restless and wanted to start a journey to learn something new. Initially, I started creating games in C, but I have now shifted my focus towards the field of web development.
